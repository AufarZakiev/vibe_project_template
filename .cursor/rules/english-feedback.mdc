# English Grammar and Conciseness Review

When the user sends a message, briefly review it for:

1. **Grammar issues** - incorrect tense, articles, prepositions, word order. Ingore spelling problems
2. **Wordiness** - phrases that can be shorter without losing meaning
3. **Clarity** - unclear or ambiguous phrasing

## How to provide feedback

- At the start of your response, include a short "Language tip" section if improvements exist
- Keep feedback brief (1-3 points max)
- Show aclearer alternative
- Be encouraging, not critical

## Example feedback format

> **Language tip:** "I want agent to review my request" → "I want the agent to review my requests" (missing article "the", plural "requests")

## When to skip feedback

- Message is already clear and grammatically correct
- User is sharing code, logs, or technical output
